# C-P-Saccades-Helper
A simple utility for calling out targets in C-P Saccades Exercises to Improve TBI and PCS symptoms

## Purpose

This procedure explores the relationship between the central (inward) and the peripheral (outward). It allows you to expand the volume of space which you can deal with at one time. It also sets the stage for parallel process (being able to do several different tings at once), which is an important skill in reading, driving , playing sports, etc.

## Procedure

1. Is done while wearing a patch. Put up a small target (Post-It note with "X") on a blank wall. Add peripheral targets (Post-Its with letters of alphabet done in wide magic marker) or draw colored circles with numbers inside, etc. Usually use 4 or 5 to start. These can be increased as you become more adept.


2. Hold a stick (yardstick, etc.) with 2 hands & stand close enough to the wall so that you can touch it comfortably.


3. Focus the unpatched eye on the target & keep it there. However, be sure to be aware of the wall, the room, the colors on the stick, etc. Look "softly" at the target, because if you concentrate too hard, you will cut out some of the peripheral vision. You should be aware of the whole wall, even though the objects may be fuzzy. As you practice this, the objects will become clearer. The stick should be held out in front of you at all times.


4. Your helper should call out targets for you to touch with the stick, just using your peripheral vision. The helper should stand in front of you so he can watch your eye to see if it looks away fro mthe target. If you do not have a helper with you, make sure you know how many targets you placed on the wall and then see if you can find them all without looking away from the target.


5. After you think you have touched the target, remove your gaze from the target and check the result. Then return your eye to the center target. As your helper calls another target, repeat the same procedure.


6. Switch your patch and do the same with the other eye. Do about 2-3 minutes with each eye.


7. As you increase your ability to see the surrounding targets, increase the distance from center and the number of targets.

You can use a metronome to make it more difficult at 40 bpm.
